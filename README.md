# Marvellous Virtual File System

This is a simple Virtual File System (VFS) implemented in C. It provides basic file operations such as file creation, opening, reading, writing, and more. The VFS is managed using inodes, file tables, and a superblock.

## Getting Started

To compile and run the code, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aniket2002S/CustomizedVirtualFileSystem
cd marvellous-vfs
gcc vfs.c -o vfs
./vfs

Project Structure
vfs.c: Main source code file containing the implementation of the VFS.
...
Dependencies
List any dependencies your project relies on.

Usage
The VFS supports various commands for interacting with files. Here are some examples:

ls: List all files in the virtual file system.
create: Create a new file with specified permissions.
...
Refer to the "Help" command within the program for a complete list of available commands.
